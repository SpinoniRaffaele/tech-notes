Aspect Oriented Programming is a type of programming that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns from the business code.
A cross-cutting concern is a functionality that is tangled with the business code and scattered in different parts of it, it usually cannot be separated from the business logic

ex: auditing (ensuring compliance with requirements), security, logging, transaction management, caching, internationalization, error-detection, performance-monitoring, synchronization.
In order to separate the cross-cutting concerns 'aspect' are used, aspects are added to the business code during compilation.
AOP implies declaring an **aspect** class that will alter the behavior of base code by applying **advices** to specific **join points** specified by **pointcuts**.

With AOP a specific execution (like a method) gets wrapped by an AOP Proxy to add cross-cutting actions transparently from the caller.
code tangling: different functionalities mixed in the code (the cross-cutting concerns and the business logic)
code scattering: repeating the same small piece of code everywhere.

Spring AOP is build on top of AspectJ, it uses dynamic proxies build over the base class (by extending it or by implementing the same interface),

* Aspect: a class containing code specific to a cross-cutting concern, annotated with @Aspect
* Weaving: the act of combining objects with other objects to create an advised object.
* Join Point: a point in the code execution, it's where the base code and the aspect joins.
* Advice: the action taken by an aspect at a join point (before advice, after returning advice, after throwing advice, after advice, around advice)
* Pointcut: a predicate used to identify join points (written in AspectJ Pointcut Expression Language)
* AOP Proxy: the proxy created by AOP to implement the aspect

After importing the **spring AOP** module (and the **aspectjweaver** dependency), In the code you need to enable the aspect proxy support at config level:
```
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy  //interface proxy by default
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy(proxyTargetClass = true)  //class proxy usign CGLIB under the hood, working at bytecode level
```
Then you need to create an aspect cluss, it must be a bean and also annotated with @Aspect, inside this class you create the advice methods:
```
@Aspect
@Component
public class Aspect {

    @Before("execution(public * com.example.Service+.method(..))")
    public void beforeMethod(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        //cross-cutting consern logic
    }
}
```

The syntax of the pointcut expression is
```
execution( [Modifiers] [ReturnType] [FullClassName].[MethodName]([Arguments]) throws [ExceptionType])
```
it can contain wildcard, \* to replace any group of characters and + can be placed after the FullClassName indicating that also a subclass is included
you can concatenate more expressions with logical operators: &&, ||.

* ReturnType is mandatory (you can use \* if more applies)
* Modifiers is not mandatory and it defaults to public
* the method name is mandatory
* The Arguments are mandatory: the use of (..) matches any arguments number and type, if you want to match method with zero argument: (), if one argument: (\*)

example:
```
@Before("execution(* com.example.*.Repo+.findBy*(..)) || execution(* com.example.service.*Service+.findBy*(..))")
```

You can also use the expression:
```
within([FullClassName])
within(com.example.AnnotationName)
```
to filter only classes annotated with a specific annotation

You can also give names to pointcut expressions to increase readability
```
@Aspect
@Component
public class AspectClass {
    @Pointcut("execution(....)")  //you can also externalize these annotated method to another class to split concerns, you will need to refer to them with the full name than (allThePackages.className.methodName)
    public void pointCut1() {}

    @Pointcut("execution(....)")
    public void pointCut2() {}

    @Before("pointCut1() || pointCut2()")
    public void beforeAdvice(JoinPoint join) {
        //implementation
    }
}
```

The JoinPoint instance passed to the aspect contains information about the method in the base code:
```
joinPoint.getSignature().getName();  //the String representing the method name
jointPoint.getArgs(); //the Object[] representing the list of args as input to the method
jointPoint.getTarget(); //the ClassName representing the class' instance in which the method advised is executed
```

**@Before**
the advice method is executed before the target, if the before advice throws an exception, the target method won't be executed.
Used for validation purposes, to performs check before allowing a certain action.

**@AfterReturning**
Executed after the base method only if this one returns correctly, it has a '**returning'** attributes that access the returned value of the base method
```
@AfterReturning(value = "//the pointcut expression...", returning = "result")
public void afterAdvice(JoinPoint joinPoint, Person result) {
    //implementation
}
```
this is generally used for caching purposes

**@AfterThrowing**
It executes only if the base method throws an exception, it is the same as AfterReturning, but it has the '**throwing**' parameter, binded to a general 'Exception' field
This advice does not stop the propagation of the exception but it can change the type of exception

**@After**
Executes after the method whatever the result. It's suitable for auditing and logging (no additional fields in the annotation)

**@Around**
is the most powerful, it encapsulates the target method, it can decide whether the method executes or not, and can modify the result returned.
Instead of the **JointPoint** input field, it has the **ProceedingJoinPoint** which gives you the power to do the mentioned things.
It is the only method not returning void but an Object (which is mandatory)
```
@Around("//pointcut expression")
public Object aroundAdvise(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
    //perform checks
    Object result = joinPoint.preoceed();
    //perform other checks
    return result;
}
```

**LIMITATIONS**
only public joinPoints can be advised, aspect can only be applied to spring beans, if in the base class, the advised method calls internally another advised method, only the outmost advice will be executed (due to how the proxy works)

**SPRING BOOT**
The only difference in spring boot is the package to import: spring-boot-starter-app, which carries all the dependencies, then it's the same
