After the development, a spring application needs to be monitored in production, there are multiple tools that we can use to perform the following:
- monitoring application log data
- monitoring application errors
- monitor server memory and CPUs
- monitor network bandwidth usage
- monitor performance of single web requests
- trace transactions

There is a helpful jUnit annotation *@RepeatedTest(1000)* at method level that is used to repeat a test in parallel, perfect for stress test scenarios.

The JDK provides a monitoring tool (the executable is under* JAVA_HOME/bin* ), JConsole.
After running your developed app you can run the JConsole application and choose the java process to monitor. After, a different metrics will be visible:
- Heap Memory usage (of the webserver used by the application)
- Threads
- Classes (classes loaded in memory, does not reflect the objects instantiated)
- CPU usage
In general, in a spring application the classes does not change since they are loaded at boostrap, also the number of threads will stay more or less constant if you use only singleton beans.

## Actuator

Spring boot contains a module called Actuator that provides endpoints and infrastructure beans useful for monitoring a Spring Boot application.

It has a health check-up: the */health* endpoint, that can be extensively configured
It has an auditing framework that publishes events (mainly security events), that can be accessed via the */auditevents* endpoint.
It has a */metrics* endpoint that can be used to diagnostically examine metrics collected by an application.

From a spring boot application you can add the actuator dependency: spring-boot-starter-actuator
and you will have two endpoints out of the box: */health* and */info*, both under the */actuator* prefix.

The */health* provides only *{"status": "UP}* by default, but you can request more details (such as the database info and the disk space info) overriding configurations in the application.yml:
```
management:
	endpoint:
		health:
			show-details: always
```

You can map the monitoring endpoints to other names:
```
management:
	endpoint:
		web:
			path-mapping:
				health: salud   # health is now accessible under /salud
```
You can change the port on which the actuator is accessible
```
management:
	server:
		port: 9091
		address: 127.0.0.1 # makes the endpoint accesible only from whithin the server
```

The */info* endpoint returns *{}* by default. But you can add any information in the application.yml:
```
info:
	app:
		name: The name
		version: 2.1
```

If you want to customize the output of the */health* endpoint programmatically you need to implement the *HealthIndicator* functional interface in a bean and implement the *health* method:
```
@Component
public class HealthChecker implements HealthIndicator, ApplicationContextAware {
	private ApplicationContext ctx;

	@Override
	public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) {
		this.ctx = applicationContext;
	}

	@Override
	public Health health() {
		if (ctx.getBean("MyBean") != null) {
			return Health.up().withDetails(...).build();
		} else {
			return Health.down().withDetails(...).build();
		}
	}
}

```
There are four health statuses that are mapped to specific HTTP status codes by default:
- UP -> 200
- DOWN -> 503 (Service Unavailable)
- OUT_OF_SERVICE -> 200
- UNKNOWN -> 200
other statuses can be added using the application.yml:
```
management:
	health:
		status:
			http-mapping:
				FATAL: 501
```

Apart from the health and info endpoints enabled by default, you can enable them all:
```
management:
	endpoints:
		web:
			exposure:
				incude: "*"
```

Here i put some details about the most important:
- /beans: it shows all the beans active in the spring context, together with their scopes and dependencies.
- /caches: exposes available spring caches.
- /configsprop: exposes all the properties used to configure the spring application (command line argument, application.yml property, *@ConfigurationProperties* property)
- /env: exposes the environment veriables values.
- /loggers: exposes info about the logging framework and loggin level used in the application, they can be customized wihout stopping the application.
- /heapdump, /threadump: clean up the heap and the threads used the the JVM process.
- /metrics, it shows metrics, it can be filtered like */metrics/{metricName}* where the metricName is a filter that in pivotal terms is called **tag**

You can now exclude some of these endpoints:
```
management:
	endpoints:
		web:
			exposure:
				incude: "*"
				exclude: env,beans
```

There is also a special endpoint that needs to be activated in a different manner: the /shutdown endpoint which shutdown the application, but requires a POST to be sent (not just a GET like the others):
```
management:
	endpoints:
		shutdown:
			enabled: true
```

## Securing Actuator Endpoints
as for any other endpoint you can secure it using the *EndpointRequest* in the security config class that extends the *WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter*:
```
class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
	@Override
	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Excpetion {
		http.
		...
		.and()
		.requestMatcher(EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint()).authorizeRequests()
		.anyRequest().hasRole("ADMIN")
		....
	}
}
```
or a more fine grained example:
```
class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
	@Override
	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Excpetion {
		http.
		...
		.and()
		.requestMatcher(EndpointRequest.to("health")).authorizeRequests()
		.anyRequest().hasRole("USER")
		....
	}
}
```
## Custom Endpoint

To write your own actuator endpoint you need a bean annotated with *@Endpoint(id = "endpointName")* (which supports both JMX and HTTP requests), or its specializations: *@WebEndpoint*, *@JmxEndpoint*.
Then you need to annotate the methods with one of:
- *@ReadOperation* -> GET request
- *@WriteOperation* -> POST request
- *@DeleteOperation* -> DELETE
```
@Component
@WebEndpoint(id = "dao")
public class DaoActuator {
	@ReadOperation
	public daoRead() {
		...
	}

	@ReadOperation
	public daoReadFilter(@Selector String name) {
		...
	}
}
```
Notice the selector annotation over the input parameter which allows for a path variable postfixed in the request URL (ex: *localhost/actuator/dao/person* which sets the *name* field to '*person*').

## Metrics
The spring boot actuator is using Micrometer dependency to gather the metrics that are then returned by the */metrics* endpoint.
Those can be grouped in different categories:
- JVM: gerbage collector activity, heap, threads, mmm
- CPU usage
- spring component activity
- Cache activity
- Datasource and connection pool activity
- Tomcat usage
- web requests latencies

In order to view nicely these micrometer metrics you can add the dependency on **Prometheus**:
*micrometer-registry-prometheus*.
Then the spring boot autoconfiguration process will detect the dependency and the actuator will expose a new endpoint (/actuator/prometheus) that is using Prometheus under the hood.
The output of the endpoint is still text though; in order to see a nice dashboard you need to install prometheus locally and configure it a bit to extract the data from the right enpoint, and then you will start prometheus and see the dashboards.
