For the JWT token setup in spring security see this repo:

# SESSION

The default in memory session stored in the mem of the server has a couple of problem:
- restarting the appliclation will cause the users to lose their session
- the session is tied to a single server, if i scale horizontally it's not going to work
Spring session solves this by using a data source to store the session.

If you include spring-boot-docker-compose dep in a spring boot app it will start the docker-compose.yml file automatically at startup, it shut down the container at application end.
you can customize this in the application.yml with 
`'spring.docker.compose.lifecycle-management=start_only'`

# OAuth2

(initializr with spring web and OAuth2 client)

You need to provide a custom security config in the *securityFilterChain* bean definition:
```
http.authorizeHttpRequest(auth -> {
	auth.requestMatchers("/").permitAll();
	auth.anyRequest().authenticated();
})
.oauth2Login(Customizer.withDefaults())
.formLogin(Customizer.withDefaults())  // you can remove it if you want to remove the option of classic form login
.build();
```

Then in the application.properties:
```
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-id=${CLIENT_ID}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-secret=${CLIENT_SECRET}
```

to get the OaUTH capability from an oauth server, you need to register your oauth application to the provider (google/github) the callback URl is by default for spring:
`http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github`   the last part is the name of the provider.

After registering you will get the client ID and the client secret.


# H2 unsecured

when including the H2 database you will expose by default a /h2-console endpoint by default that let's you interact with the h2 DB. adding spring security locks it, so for dev profiles we might want to interact with it, to do so you can setup this config specific for h2:
```
http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> {
	auth.requestMatchers("/h2-console/**")
})
.csrf(csrf -> csrf.ignoringRequestMatchers("/h2-console/**"))
.headers(headers -> headers.frameOptions().disable())
.build();
```

while the */api* endpoints are secured using the *apiSecurityFilterChain* bean declaration that uses oauth as shown in the previous section.

Now that you have these 2 configurations you need a way to tell spring which one to take based on the request:
To do so you add a .securityMatcher(path) in each customization, like for example:
```
http
.securityMatcher("/api/**")
.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> {
	auth.requestMatchers("/h2-console/**")
})
.csrf(csrf -> csrf.ignoringRequestMatchers("/h2-console/**"))
.headers(headers -> headers.frameOptions().disable())
.build();
```
