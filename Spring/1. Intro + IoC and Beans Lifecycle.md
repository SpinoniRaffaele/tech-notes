Spring is an open source framework (the difference from a library being that a library is generally a single jar providing a single functionality, while a framework is a set of dependency as jars that provide more heterogeneus functionality over different topics).

Spring comes to cover the problematics of developing an application JEE (developing time and cost, pattern bad implemented, complexity of OJB)
spring is not in a substitution of JEE but it integrates it.
one framework for each functionality
log -> logback used with slf4j on top.
MVC web -> Spring-MVC (alternative to Jersey, implementing JAX-RS)
ORM -> Hiberante (which is an implementation of JPA), an alternative is EclipseLink
testing -> JUnit
security -> spring-security
configuration -> Spring-IOC

**History**
It was born in 2002- 2003 and nowadays is an entire ecosystem, now it's at version 6.
In Spring 1 only XML config was possible, from 2.5 java annotations came enabling easier configuration. In spring 3 we have the Configuration classes used to configure the framework, and an introduction of SpEL. Spring 4 -> spring boot is introduced and the websocket is introduced (2013).
Spring 5 (2017), add the spring boot version 2, added spring-webflux for reactive implementtiton of spring-mvc,
Spring 6 -> moved over java 17, and spring boot 3.

**Layered Architecture**:
objective -> maintenance: less coupling as possible
how?-> each layer depends on the interfaces of the other layers, not on the implementation directly
how practically? -> with dependency injection

**POJO**: it has an empty constructor, it can have some fields and it has setters and getters for each attribute.

Linking a component with their dependency is called **dependency injection**, before spring entered in the picture, the dependency where provided following design patterns (Factory, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Builder, Decorator, Proxy, Service Locator). Spring introduces the idea of **inversion of control** meaning that you don't need to provide the dependency but is the framework that does it for you.

**Inversion of control is a common characteristic in framework  that facilitates the injection of dependencies.**
**Dependency injection pattern is based on having an object that takes care of injecting dependency with the required behavior based on an interface contract.**

The software components that Spring uses are called Beans, they are POJOs created, managed, initialized by Spring IoC which also take care of dependency injection. When we build a spring application a lot of infrastructure beans need to be created and configured, Spring framework provides **CONVENTION OVER CONFIGURATION** which means that the most standard configuration is automaticaly provided for you by the framework. **Spring Boot is the epitome of convention over configuration** where you can have a working application with almost no configuration.

The spring Ioc container has the responsability of connecting the beans based on a provided configuration (XML or Java annotation) in order to provide a working application.
![[Pasted image 20240118153952.png]]
**The dependency injection happens only at runtime** (while booting up), so the specific type of dependency can be changed in the configuration without the need to recompile the project (a restart is enough); this creates a **loosely coupled and easy to maintain application**.

First spring functionality is being a Factory for object, so you can create an object of a certain interface, but of possible different implementations, using a factory method. The spring factory class is called BeanFactory
initialize a spring context starting from the XML config:
```
BeanFactory spring = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("/spring/spring.bean.xml");

// then you can get beans
spring.getBean(Bean.class);
```

 the `BeanFactory` provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, and the `ApplicationContext` adds more enterprise-specific functionality. The `ApplicationContext` is a complete superset of the `BeanFactory`.
Within the container itself, these bean definitions are represented as `BeanDefinition` objects, which contain (among other information) the following metadata:
- A package-qualified class name: typically, the actual implementation class of the bean being defined.
- Bean behavioral configuration elements, which state how the bean should behave in the container (scope, lifecycle callbacks, and so forth).
- References to other beans that are needed for the bean to do its work. These references are also called collaborators or dependencies.
- Other configuration settings to set in the newly created object — for example, the size limit of the pool or the number of connections to use in a bean that manages a connection pool.
 
if spring is configured by XML and it cannot find a dependency to inject it just creates the beans with the null dependency without crashing.
(while the dependencies autowired with the annotation are required by default)
I fit has multiple dependencies available it crushes (NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException)

Some modules:
spring-core: provide basic utility classes and enums used by other spring modules
spring-beans: provide the basic infrastructure beans and the IoC container
spring-context: provides the ApplicationContext containing all the configured beans into the application.

Some useful annotations:

* @Component - general annotation for a spring managed bean
* @Service - bean responsible of the service layer (specialization of component)
* @Controller - bean responsible of the Web Layer (specialization of component)
* @Repository - bean responsible of the data layer, communication with the DB (specialization of component)
* @Configuration - bean responsible for configuring other beans (methods annotated with @Bean)
* @Autowired - automatically injects the dependency
* @Qualifier - use with Autowired to specify the name of the bean to inject
* @Lazy - inject the dependency only when needed (it is considered bad practice)
* @Required - marks a dependency as required, DEPRECATED
* @DependsOn - placed over a bean it defines the list of beans that need to be instantiated before the current bean.

To have a spring application you need at least one Configuration class, and a main class creating the context:

```
ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ConfigClassName.class);  //this can also be a XML file or a string
```
The application context gives access to the application's beans, or loads resources
```
ctx.getBeanDefinitionNames();      ctx.getResource("application.properties")
```
it is also able to load file resources, publish events to listeners and localize messages for internationalization

you can use the _@ImportResource("spring.xml")_ on top of the config class, in order to import the xml config, in case you have a mixed config.

RESOURCE PASSED AS A STRING
To pass a resource in spring as a string you have different options:

* no prefix: the file is to be found right under the resource directory in main or test.
* classpath: the resource is to be found in the classpath, if this resource is used to initialize the context, it should be of type ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
* file: the full path of the resource, to be used with FileSystemXmlApplicationContext
* http: the url of the resource, to be used with WebApplicationContext

**Beans**
The beans declared in the configuration file are in the form of method returning the bean type (or supertype):
```
@Bean
MyBean myBean() {
    return new MyBeanImplementation();
}
```
By default spring implements the singleton pattern to the bean, ensuring that only one instance is created.

@ComponentScan Annotation allows spring to automatically search for bean and declares them for you (the bean classes should be annotated with the @Component children annotations).
The annotation is to be placed at class level in the config class, it is an antipattern to use it naked because of the performance issues caused by spring searching in all your project. The most common usage is specifying the package:
```
@ComponentScan(baseBakages = {"com.example"})
```

Implementations by default pre-instantiate singleton beans. At the cost of some upfront time and memory to create these beans before they are actually needed, you discover configuration issues when the `ApplicationContext` is created, not later. You can still override this default behavior so that singleton beans initialize lazily, rather than being eagerly pre-instantiated.

**Properties**
The @PropertySource annotation enables spring to load properties from a property file (.properties or .yml).
You should always externalize the properties used to configure beans (so that the application became configurable)
Each one of this property can be provided when running the start of the application as a command line argument (VM Options -[Doption.name=optionValue](http://Doption.name=optionValue)), the command line argument has a priority over the default value in the .properties

```
@PropertySource("classpath:db/db.properties")

//read value after in the code
@Value("${db.server.port}")
String port;
```

It can be used in any class in spring  also in the configuration class itself with a small addition:
```
@Configuration
@PropertySource("classpath:db/db.properties")
class Config {
    @Value("${db.server.hostname}")
    String hostname;

    @Bean
    @Description("this is a description of the bean")
    static PropertySourcePlaceholderConfigurer propertySourcePlaceHolderConfigurer() {
        return new PropertySourcePlaceholderConfigurer();
    }
}
```
The small addition is the property source placeholder configurer which enable to property processing for the config class, it is essential to follow the naming convention and to mark it as **static** in this way it will be picked up before the config class instantiation. This configurer essentially works by substituting the properties with their values, this means that the configuration class is proxied by an infrastructure bean -> hence it cannot be final.

The programmatic alternative approach to the annotations is this:
```
@Configuration
public class Config {
    Properties propertyBean() {
        try {
            return PropertiesLoaderUtils.loadProperties(new ClassPathResource("application.properties"));
        } catch (IOException e) {//blabla}
    }
}
```

Under the hood the bean that make the property injection possible is the Environment bean which collects the set of all the property names and value, you can directly use it in any bean:
```
@Autowired
Environment environment;

...
environment.getProperty("db.driverName");
```

The environment Bean also manages **PROFILES**
A profile is a set of beans definition that is registered within the Spring IoC container only when the profile is active.
Profiles are perfect when you have to split configurations based on the environment.
To make a configuration class specific to a profile you have to annotate it at class level with the @Profile annotation.
and then add the @ActiveProfiles("profileName") to the context creating class/test. (or you need to add a parameter to the servletContext in case of a web application):
```
public class WebInitializer extends AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer {
  @Override
  public void onStartup(ServletContext servletContext) throws ServletException {
    servletContext.setInitParameter(
        "spring.profiles.active", "prod");
    super.onStartup(servletContext);
  }
}
```
When specifying an active profile, spring bootstrap the beans included in all the configs that are not associated to any profiles, and the configs that are associated with the specififed profile.
You can also specify the profile annotation at method level together with the @Bean annotation over a bean definition method.

**INJECTION**
\-constructor injection (its' perfect because it ensures that the class always has all the required dependencies, all or nothing. From Spring 4, if the class has only one constructor there is no need to even write the annotation)
\-field injection (it uses reflection, bad for performances and harder to test, (how to you unit test it?))
\-setter injection, add the annotation on each setter method. It is in general considered a code smell.
(Reasons to use setter injection: you need to be able to reconfigure the bean after instantiation, or you are handling legacy code)

The bean name is the bean class name with the first letter downcase, in case you want another name you have to put it inside the @Component annotation (or one of its specialization).
For the bean declared in the config class, it takes the name of the output class (first letter downcased), unless you specify another name in the Bean annotation:
```
@Bean(name = {"bean1","bean2"})  //this bean has two names
```

When autowiring, spring select which bean to inject, this is done by

* Searching for a Bean matching the type, if more than one is found then:
* Searching for a @Qualifier annotation (present over the same field that has the @Autowired annotation) that matches a bean name, if nothing or multiple beans are found, then:
* Searching by name (the name of the autowired parameter), if nothing or multiple beans are still matching -> throw NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException (you can also fix the multiple beans by annotating one with @Primary, it's going to be chosen)

in XML you can choose to set the autowired property of the bean (or not) and you can set it to byType or byName and you can also tag a bean as not available to be autowired (autowire-candidate=false)

You can inject primitive types, by simply using @Value annotation.
```
@Value("string1") String field; //file hardcoded
@Value("${db.port}") int port; //field from properties file
```
The spring IoC container knows how to inject all the primitive types (and their wrapper types , like Integer).
In order to automatically convert more complext types you need to provide an implementation in a bean that is then added in the configuration. The bean must Implement the **Converter** interface (of spring.core)
Example:
```
@Component
public class MyConverter implements Converter {
    @Override
    public LocalDate convert(String source) {
        return LocalDate.parse(source, DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd"));
    }
}

//bean configuration:
@Configuration
public class Config {
    @Autowired
    MyConverter converter;

    @Bean
    ConversionServiceFactoryBean conversionServiceFactoryBean() {
        ConversionServiceFactoryBean factory = new ConversionServiceFactoryBean();
        factory.setConverters(Set.of(converter));
        return factory;
    }
}
```

You can also inject a list of beans, nothing prevents you to do it. (from spring 4 you can also inject types that differs only for the generic: List<String>, List<Actor>)

By default the @Autowired requires the dependency as mandatory, but this can be overridden:
```
@Autowired(required = false)
```
this means that spring will search for the dependency anyway, but if it is not found it will simply inject a null value instead of throwing an exception.

The @Lazy annotation can be used together with @Component (or its specialization) or @Bean. It and add the dependency only when it's used, it's useful when the dependency is huge, but it makes the application harder to develop and troubleshoot. You can also plase @Lazy together with @Autowired on a filed or setter or constructor, but then you also need to add 'required = false' to the autowired otherwise it won't be really lazily injected.

**SCOPE**
The bean scope is a term describing its lifespan. By default it is singleton. You can change the scope of a bean by annotating it with @Scope at class level together with @Component (or its specializations) or even together with @Bean annotation in a config class.

@Scope("singleton")  there is also an enum value for each type:  @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE\_SINGLETON)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Scope | Description |
| [singleton](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch04s04.html#beans-factory-scopes-singleton) | Scopes a single bean definition to a single object instance per Spring IoC container. |
| [prototype](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch04s04.html#beans-factory-scopes-prototype) | Every time this bean is requested a new instance is created |
| [request](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch04s04.html#beans-factory-scopes-request)<br>you also have the special annotation @RequestScope | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a single HTTP request; that is each and every HTTP request will have its own instance of a bean created off the back of a single bean definition. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring `ApplicationContext`. ex. loginService with some login related state |
| [session](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch04s04.html#beans-factory-scopes-global-session)<br>You also have the special annotation @SessionScope | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a HTTP `Session`. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring `ApplicationContext`. ex: userPreferences, stored for the session |
| application | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a `ServletContext`| 
| websocket | one instance for each insteance of WebSocket (valid only with web-aware context) |

In the @Scope annotation you can also specify the **proxyMode** field:
```
@Scope(proxyMode = ScopeProxyMode.INTERFACES)
@Scope(proxyMode = ScopeProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
```
This defines the type of proxy crreated by spring around the bean, it can be a proxy implementing the same interface as the bean (PREFERRED, it has one disadvantage: it can be used only if the bean implments an interface), or a proxy extending the bean class itself (also called CGLIB-based class proxy, created at runtime by spring. This type of proxy has downsides: - they only intercept public methods - you cannot define your methods or the class as final)

To make sure that all the scope values works, always provide the proxyMode (for ex. the "prototype" scope mode won't work without an explicit proxyMode)

If you don't setup the proxy and if a singleton bean needs to populate multiple instances of another bean (prototype mode), you can implement the ApplicationContextAware interface (and provide and implementation for the 'setApplicationContext' method) and then use the context object to .getBean over the prototype scoped bean. Another alternative is to use** lookup method injection**:
setup an abstract method and configure it to be used to require the bean instance from spring:
```
public abstract class CommandManager { 
	@Lookup("myCommand") 
	protected abstract Command createCommand(); 
}
```
where 'myCommand' is the bean id (it's facultative, you can let spring figure out the bean based on the returned type of the method)

All this job can be automatically handled for you by spring when a short-lives bean is used inside a long-live bean, it's enough to enable the proxy.

**LIFECYCLE**
**Initialization**: beans definitions are read, beans are created and dependencies injected (bootstrap)
**Use**: beans are just used
**Destruction**: the context is shut down, the beans are destroyed by the garbage collector.

In particular, the INITIALIZATION:

* Bean Definitions are loaded: the class definitions are loaded in memory and they are ready to be processed
* Bean definition are processed: here infrastructure beans are responsible of preprocessing (for ex. PropertySourcesPlacholderConfigurer)
* Beans are instantiated: the constructor is called
* Dependency injection: dependencies are injected (this phase coincide with the previous in case of constructor injection)
* Beans processes: **post process before initialization** is executed over the created beans
* Beans are initialized: method annotated with @PostConstruct is called
* Bean process after initialization: **post process after initialization** is executed over the created beans

Post construct and the alternatives, in order of execution (if all these methods are applied):
1 @PostConstruct (only one method can be annotated with this, and it will be executed only once, it must return void and have no parameters in input)
2 the method 'afterPropertiesSet()' implemented by the bean that is also implementing the interface 'InitializingBean'
3 the method specified in the @Bean annotation in the configuration:
```
@Bean(initMethod = "methodName")
```

When the beans are destroyed the following are executed, if present:
1 @PreDestroy (same rules of PostConstruct: only one method called only once, returns void and has no parameters)
2 the method 'destroy()' implemented by the bean that is also implementing the interface 'DisposableBean'
3 the method specified in the @Bean annotation
```
@Bean(destroyMethod = "methodName")
```

**JAVA CONFIG VS XML**
In spring it's possible to define the configuration using XML files, which makes it harder to maintain and work with: imagine adding a parameter to a constructor and searching in the various XML files the one about that class' dependency.
XML config has a main advantage though: it's completely decoupled from the code, in this way the code it's not tied to the framework.

**IMPORT**
It's generally useful to split the configuration in multiple classes based on their purposes.
when you have multiple config classes and you need to reuse some beans between them, you can import them, and inject them in the other config:
```
@Import(ConfigcClassOne.class)
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.example"})
public class ConfigClassTwo {
    @Autowired
    SharedBean sharedBean;
}
```

**SPRING BOOT**
Spring Boot is a set of preconfigured framework designed to reduce boilerplate configuration. This means that a default configuration is provided by the framework, which means that the framework is OPINIONATED: the config provided is considered to be the most suitable one (it's the most used one). Spring boot allow to set up a project in really short time by providing a common configuration that can be easily overridden, it automatically ships a set of non functional features (server, security, metrics and monitoring), it removes the need for XML configuration
include it with: _spring-boot-starter-parent_. It includes a lot of other dependencies that are curated in order to be the correct versions.

All you need to develop a spring boot application is a class annotated with @SpringBootApplication
```
@SpringBootApplication
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```
//this application automatically boot a Tomcat server when run (it's a web application)

the annotation is equivalent to the following list of annotations:

* @SpringBootConfguration (which is the spring boot version of the @Configuration annotation) this allow the App class to create beans.
* @EnableAutoConfiguration - this enables a lot of beans preconfigured for you by the framework so that you don't have to add any @Bean definition to have a working application
* @ComponentScan

The easiest way to override the spring boot config is through an application.yml file:
```
example of application.yml

server:
    port: 8081                # the port in which the app is exposed
    servlet:
        context-apth: /boot  # the base bath of the web app
```

you can also provide config with a class annotated with @SpringBootTest, using command-line args when booting, using the SPRING\_APPLICATION\_JSON environment variable in the system, using ServletConfig init paramters or ServletContext init parameters, @propertySource configurations in a @Configuration class.

The autoconfiguration done based on the dependencies + overrides done in the [application.properties](http://application.properties) is done in a JAR included in spring-boot called **spring-boot-autoconfigure** (META-INFspring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports). In the file there is a list of classes that are autoconfigured (configuration classes, declaring beans for you).

Those infrastructure beans are creste under a @ConditionalOn.. annotation (they are create only if they are not already present, spring boot c=runs your config before running the default one, creating the beans that you don't have already added).
@ConditionalOnMissingClass (if the class is not present in the context)
@ConditionalOnMissingMissingBean( if the bean is not present)
@ConditionalOnResorce: if the resource is present already in the environment bean
@CondifitonalOnProperty
@ConditionalOnWebApplication

You need to use those annotation when you want to auconfigure some beans that are linked to dependency that are not supported by spring boot, so you have to initialize them manually (you can do it always, simply adding a standard configuration, or you can condition it based on some properties values being present)
example with apache DBCP version 1 (springboot supports only the version 2), we define our custom dataSource if the property is present
```
@AutoConfiguration
@ConditionalOnProperty(prefix = "commons.dbcp", name = "datasource", havingValue = "true")
public class BasicDataSourceAutoConfiguration {
    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty(prefix = "spring.datasource", name = "url")
    @ConditionalOnClass(name = "org.h2.Driver")
    BasicDataSource dataSource(@Value("${spring.datasource.url}") String url,
                              @Value("${spring.datasource.username:sa}") String username,
                              @Value("${spring.datasource.password:}") String password) {
        BasicDataSource dataSource = new BasicDataSource();
        dataSource.setUsername(username);
        dataSource.setPassword(password);
        dataSource.setUrl(url);
        return dataSource;
    }
}
```

then you need to add the reference to the new autoconfigration class in a file that needs to have a specific name and path under resources:
```
META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports
```
inside the file you put the full class name of the autoconfig class.
In spring boot you can easily personalize a profile by associating a properties or yml file to it by using the naming convention (you put some properties on top of the basic ones in the application.properties):
```
application-PROFILENAME.properties
```
than you activate it using a single property in the main [application.properties](http://application.properties):
```
spring.profiles.active=PROFILENAME
```

For the logging spring uses Logback which is one of the implementations of Slf4J, you can override the default config of spring (having the level at INFO), using the application.properties file:
```
logging.level.root=debug
```

**SPRING INITIALIZR**
Is a website where you can enter the desired dependencies of your application (for example: WEB, JPA, H2, MONGODB) and it will automatically create for you a base spring application with all the sub-dependencies added

**SpEL**
SpEL:  spring expression language, it's a spring component, an interpreter of java expressions, expressed in a string.
The context in which the expressions work is the spring container.
```
"#{jdbcConfig.driverClass}"
"#{systemProperties['java.vm.version']}"    // access the systemProperties bean (which is a map String -> Object), accessing a key in the map
```
