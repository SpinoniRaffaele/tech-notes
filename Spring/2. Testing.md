The purpose of testing is to verify that the application satisfies the functional and non-functional requirements and to detect errors.

**Test-Driven Development**: test before writing the code, while deciding the requirements, you write tests to check them, the tests initially fail, then you start developing and the tests start to pass. It is a good technique to find problems early in the development process.

**Unit testing**: testing the smallest testable parts of code, independently and isolated from the rest, the unit is taken out of context and tested with fake dependencies. The recommendation is to  cover all the method of a class with _positive_ and _negative_ tests. JUnit is a java library that provides classes and annotations to prepare and run unit tests such as (@Test(expected = Exception.class), @Before, @After, @Ignore, and all the assertSomething methods).
There is anew version JUnit 5, where classes are inside the jupiter package: @Test, @BeforeAll (static method executed only once before all the other tests), @BeforeEach (the same as Before previously), @AfterAll, @AfterEach, @Disabled @Nested,
and the useful
```
assertThrows(() -> //call to the method to be tested)
assertAll(
    () -> assertSomething...,
    () -> assertSomething...,
)
```

**Integration testing**: running tests in a context where real dependency are provided and a big part of the application is tested at once (it's enough to test multiple units, it doesn't need to be big).

**Stubs**: a concrete class created by developers that implement the same interface as the original dependency of the unit being tested. It is a dummy implementation of the dependency.

**Mock**: is a pseudo-object replacing the real dependency of the unit being tested, the mock object doesn't have an implementation, it is generated on the fly when the test run. Mocks are provided by frameworks, such as: JMock, Mockito, EasyMock, PowerMock.

**EasyMock**
```
private Dependency mockDependency;
private Service service;

@BeforeEach
public void setUp() {
    mockDependency = createMock(Dependency.class)
    service = new Service(mockDependency);
}

@Test
public void test() {
    expect(mockDependency.method()).andReturn(//something);  //mocking a behavior

    replay(mockDependency);

    service.methodToTest(); //calling the method under test

    verify(mockDependency); //ensuring that the exepcted method was called

    //all asertions...
}
```
**JMock**
```
private Dependency mockDependency;
private Mockery mockery = new JUnit5Mockery();
private Service service;

@BeforeEach
public void setUp() {
    mockDependency = mockery.mock(Dependency.class)
    service = new Service(mockDependency);
}

@Test
public void test() {
    mockery.checking(new Expectations() {{
        allowing(mockDepndency).method();
        will(returnValue(//something))
    }})

    //call to the method to test

    mockery.assetIsSatisfied(); //ensure that the expected method was called

    //assertions...
}
```
**Mockito** \- most readable framework.
```
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
public class TestSomething {
    @Mock
    private Dependency mockDependency;

    @InjectMocks
    private Service service;  //automatically injects mocks and spies in the tested unit

    @Test
    public void test() {
        when(mockDependency.method()).thenReturn(//something);

        //call the method to be tested

        verify(mockDependency).method();  //ensure that the method was called

        //asserts...
    }
}
```

**PowerMock**
it's purpose is to test code that is not well designed and not testable, it can test more things than the other framework:

* static methods
* classes with static initializers
* final classes or final methods
* private methods and fields

It isn't really useful to test spring application, because if well designed there is no need for static elements and the classes will be testable by default.

**INTEGRATION TESTING WITH SPRING AND JUNIT 4**
you need to annotate the test class with
```
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = {Config1.class, Config2.class}) 
//config classes that are taken into account to instantiate the beans to create the context in which the test execute
```
you can then annotate the tested class inside the test class with @Autowired to let spring inject the dependencies.

You can also specify the context's configuration inside the testing class directly thanks to the AnnotationConfigContextLoader
```
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(loader = AnnotationConfigContextLoader.class)
public class Test {
    @Configuration
    static class TestConfig {
        @Bean... //all the needed beans definitions
    }

    @Autowired
    private Service service

    @Test... //test methods
}
```

**INTEGRATION TESTING WITH SPRING AND JUNIT 5**
you need to annotate the testing class with
```
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) //only change
@ContextConfiguration //this is the same as before

//otherwise you can merge the two annotations into one
@SpringJUnitConfig(classes = {...})
```
and then you @Autowired the service as usual.

You can also use mockito to mock part of the dependency instead of creating the full context (creating a mixed scenario with fake and real dependencies), by using the @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) as in the unit tests:
```
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)  //essential to work
@ContextConfiguration(loader = AnnotationContextLoader.class) //need for the config inside the class but not necessary
public class Test {
    @ClassRule
    public static final SpringClassRule rule = new SpringClassRule();  //spring magic

    @Rule
    public final SpringMethodRule methodRule = new SpringMethodRule();  //spring magic

    @Autowired
    Service service;

    @Autowired
    MockedDependency dependency;

    @Configuration
    static class TestConfig {
        @Bean
        MockedDependency dep() {
            return mock(MockedDependency.class);
        }

        @Bean
        Service serv() {
            return new Service(dep());
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void Test {
        when(dependency.method).thenReturn(//something);  //mock the dependency method

        service.methodToTest();

        //assertions
    }
}
```

**OTHER ANNOTATION**
Another useful annotation at test method level for integration testing is @Sql, whenever you are testing something that works with an SQL DB, it refers to a SQL statement to be executed before the test starts:
```
@Test
@Sql({"classpath:db/test-create-db.sql"})  //referring to a file where the sql query is written

or

@Test
@Sql(statements = {"INSERT INTO PERSON(ID, USERNAME) VALUES (2, "Irene);"})
```

The sql annotation can be used at class level and in this case it executes before each test method in the class.
You can also specify a parameter to specify the moment of execution of the query, or more infos about the sql syntax to use
```
@Sql(
statements = "DELETE FROM PERSON",
executionPhase = Sql.ExecutionPhase.AFTER_TEST_METHOD,  //this executes after the test, the default is before
config = @SqlConfig(commentPrefix = "`")
)
```

**PROFILES**
as mentioned before you can also activate different profiles in different tests,
you can annotate them at class level with:
```
@ActiveProfiles("profileName")
```
Since the profiles load different configurations, this annotation makes sense only when configurations are taken into account so into integration tests.

**SPRING BOOT**
In spring boot you can use a special annotation to create integration testing:
@SpringBootTest that automatically looks for the @SpringBootApplication annotated class to bootstrap the test context

You can customize the context by using specific annotations in the boot test class, or using the [application.properties](http://application.properties) file.
Example of customization:
```
@SpringBottTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
//this avoids to create the web context - supposing it is not needed in this test
```
