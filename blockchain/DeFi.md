DeFi stands for Decentralized finance, it's a movement away from centralized authorities in the financial world. The trust in this type of finance is given by the cryptographic proof in the blockchain

The aave protocol treats every token as an ERC-20 token to ease the swaps and transactions, that's why you have wETH (ETH wrapped in an ERC-20 token).
wETH is both the token and the contract, you can interact with it depositing ETH into it in order to mint wETH that are given to you. When you want to reconvert wETH into ETH you send another call to this contract that burns the wETH and gives you back the ETH.
